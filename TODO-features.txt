DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS
    Written vim-like commands       Some features may require more complex input, such as writing out path names to
                                    new images for import (during runtime). Also add support for writing (':w') out
                                    to file, and/or quitting program (':q').

    Image editing                   So far, the proposed Vimnail features define it as more of an image compositor.
                                    Which is fine; I think this serves it's intended purpose well. If there is will
                                    to add pixel modification (color, alpha) support without a mouse, then some big
                                    ideas should be brainstormed, as this could very well shape the rest of the
                                    project.
